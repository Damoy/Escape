Escape! - Ludum Dare 39 - End 01/08/2017
#######

Here's a little game I made for the ludum dare 39 jam in Java, from scratch.
I used paint.net for textures, Eclipse as IDE and old sounds I got.
The theme was "Running out of Power".
You have to escape each level without running out of power ;)

You can shoot only up and down, which uses one power.
There are power boost, keys, enemies and obstacles.

Hope you'll like it !
